# DaysAliveCalculator
A calculator that counts the number of days you have been alive. 

This is the Days Alive Calculator from the the Udacity Python course. I Converted this to java and uploaded both files, this is the Java program. I did this because when I learn something in python I want to teach myself how to do it in another language.
